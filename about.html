<h2>I'm Casey.</h2>
<p>I'm a technical writer who has made a promise to start writing more outside of work hours. I'm interested in user documentation, really loose information typing, and writing for the incoming generation of workers.</p>

<p>My free time is generally spent target shooting, learning to code, and talking about cats. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyrfowler">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/humeansacrifice">GitHub</a></p>
<p>All views on this blog are mine, and mine alone.</a>
<p>About this blog: I'm using the <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/clean-blog/">Clean Blogs Theme</a> for Jekyll. The images I use either came with the theme, or come from <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>.
