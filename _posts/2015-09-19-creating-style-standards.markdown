_Note: This post is intended for non-writers who need to write help documentation. However, most content creators can benefit from the advice here!_


In a [previous post](/2015/09/10/your-startup-needs-style-standards/), I mentioned that you need to create style standards for your help content sooner rather than later. The big takeaway in that post is that style standards breed consistency, and consistency makes your content more helpful, scalable, and trustworthy. This post assumes that you don't have a marketing or documentation team, and that you don't have any explicit style guidelines.

In this post, I outline the basics of getting your own [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide) up and running.

##take stock

The first step to create a style guide is to take stock of what content you already have. You can do this with a [content audit](http://uxmastery.com/how-to-conduct-a-content-audit/). Although you don't have to do a _full_ content audit, it can save you work down the road. I talk about the benefit of full content audits in [this post about my first year as a writer](/2015/01/10/what-i-wish-id-done/).

During the audit, pay attention to what your content says, how it's saying it, and how it's formatted. Start taking notes.
Here are some things to look out for:

- Do you use H1 or H2 for top-level headings?
- How do you refer to your product, services, or components?
- How do you write words with multiple accepted spellings? Is it _dropdown_ or _drop down_, or _drop-down_? Is is _clickthrough_ or _click-through_?
- Which verbs are you using for actions? Is it _navigate to_ or _go to_? Is it _enter_ or _type_?

Once you're done with your audit you should have 3 things: a list of your content, a grasp on your organization's voice and tone, and an idea of how inconsistent your docs are.

##decide how you want to say things

If you don't already have brand guidelines that outline your organization's voice and tone, you should start there. Voice is your organization's communication _style_ or _personality_. Tone is your content's _mood_. Tone should adapt to what kind of content you're creating. For example, your marketing content might have a more exciting tone than your help content.

You can find your voice by asking _If our brand were a person, what would they be like?_ Is your brand bubbly, friendly, droll, or sarcastic? Find it and go with it -- write down a paragraph with a few adjectives that describe your voice. For example:

<blockquote>Our brand is bubbly and informal, but not too zealous or too chummy.
Our brand is an expert in our field, but is never condescending.
</blockquote>

 Bam! Now you're ready to move on.

_If you still have no idea what I'm talking about, MailChimp has an excellent [guide to voice and tone](http://voiceandtone.com/)._

##make a list

The next step is to create an alpha list (sometimes called a word list). An alpha list is essentially a dictionary for your organization. It should be part of a comprehensive style guide, but it's nice to have a separate list that you can use as a quick reference.

 This is where you decide _how_ you're going to write your product components, services, team names, and so on. Creating this list will go  far in keeping your docs consistent.

Your alpha list can be as simple as a Google Sheet -- just type the word as it should be used. For example, if you've decided that _dropdown_ is the spelling you're going to use, write it down!

##write the style guide

The quickest and easiest way to do this is to take a popular style guide and modify it for your own needs. For example, you can use [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/), but modify it to use serial commas (you should totally use serial commas, you savage). If you want to start from scratch, here are a few questions to get you started:

- How will you write out dates, time, telephone numbers, website URLs, or email addresses?
- Are you going to allow _e.g_, _i.e_, _etc_, or should you use something like _for example_ and _and so on_?
- How about acronyms, abbreviations and initialisms? Are there cases where using these is okay?
- Will you use [logical punctuation](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_good_word/2011/05/the_rise_of_logical_punctuation.html) or traditional?

Ask yourself a slew of questions, and then write it all down.

_If you're totally overwhelmed already, just borrow someone else's style guide. MailChimp is particularly gracious and invites you to adapt their [style guide](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/)._

##write article content standards

Here's where the real help docs stuff comes into play. You need to explicitly describe how each article should be structured and the kinds of content they will contain. You can ask a few questions to get started:

- What kinds of articles will you need? How tos? References and glossaries? FAQs? Think about the types your readers need. A good basic starting point is concept, task, and reference:
  - Concept articles give a broad overview of a concept.
  - Task articles contain instructions for doing something.
  - Reference articles contain more technical content like definitions and specifications.
- How will you write out navigation paths? Will it be _Navigate to Home > Settings_ or _Go to Home, then click Settings_?
- What will your article naming convention be like? Should task articles be named _How to do the thing_ or _Doing the thing_? Should FAQs be named _xyz FAQs_ or _xyz Frequently Asked Questions_?

Figure out your needs, and then write down the rules.

**Note on task steps**: Steps that should be done in order should _always_ be numbered lists. Avoid using numbered lists for anything that isn't a task.

##keep it updated

Your style guide should be a living document -- don't go through the trouble of creating one and then let it gather dust. Your guide should evolve as your organization does. A well-used and maintained style guide will help keep content consistent and on-brand.
