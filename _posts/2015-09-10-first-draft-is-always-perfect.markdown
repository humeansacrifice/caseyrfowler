I know I said I was going to write a series on creating style guidelines without a writer, but something came up today, and I need to address it.

I was talking to a work colleague about documentation, and he apologized about how his notes were a "bad first draft" of a proposal. Without even thinking, I blurted out "the first draft is always perfect, because all it needs to do is exist".

That's right. The first draft is always perfect. _perfect_. Its only job is to exist. Like minerals. Like dirt. Like air. It just needs to _be_. All a first draft need be is an idea borne into reality. A first draft is something made tangible from nothing -- its only purpose is to pierce the space between your thoughts and the reality we all share.


I picked up this wisdom from my thesis advisor. After a semester and a summer of research, I was struggling with getting the thoughts out onto paper. I was starting to fall behind schedule. After listening to me whining about how I _just couldn't_ express what I had to say, my advisor challenged me. He said:

<blockquote>Casey. You're overthinking it. Just sit down and write. The first draft is <em>always</em> perfect. All it's got to do is exist. So just sit down and write.</blockquote>

His advice stuck. I banged out a first draft within a few weeks. I revised, re-thought, and re-imagined that draft. I ended up with a kick-ass <a href="https://app.box.com/s/97wqhr72bwcjztfx7p2rfgfgoi02wdf8">thesis</a> that I'm absolutely proud of. I still have my first draft somewhere, and I'm sure it's perfect.

Just write.
